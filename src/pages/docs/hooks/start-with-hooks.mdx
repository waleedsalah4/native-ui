### start with hooks

Custom Hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow you to extract reusable stateful logic from components.
By encapsulating common logic into custom hooks, you can promote code reusability, improve component organization, and enhance code maintainability.

Think of custom hooks as functions that can be used within components to manage specific pieces of state or side effects. They provide a way to share logic across multiple components without duplicating code. This is especially useful for common patterns like data fetching, form handling, animations, and more.

By leveraging custom hooks, you can create more focused and reusable components, making your React applications more efficient and easier to understand.

In this documentation, we'll explore a collection of custom hooks that we've built to address common use cases. Each hook will be accompanied by detailed explanations, code examples, and usage guidelines.
