### Requirments

As we are building this components for Reactjs or Nextjs, you will need the following to able to use the component

#### Technologies

1. Reactjs / Nextjs
   choose what you like, components should work with both, but for the Nextjs app directory you may need to add `"use client"` directive for the component the uses reactjs hooks like `useState, useEffect,..etc`

2. For the design we use CSS/tailwind CSS

3. For Dates we use [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) library
   install it only if the component to need uses it, or if you need it in general

4. For Icons we use [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/), you can use prefered icon library

5. These are the basics, any extra packages will be mentioned for the component itself
