description: As we are building this components for Reactjs or Nextjs, you will need the following to able to use the component
---

#### Technologies

1. Reactjs / Nextjs
   choose what you like, components should work with both, but for the Nextjs app directory you may need to add `"use client"` directive for the component the uses reactjs hooks like `useState, useEffect,..etc`

2. For the design we use CSS/tailwindCSS
3. `tailwind-merge` `clsx` to efficiently manage and combine your Tailwind CSS classes

4. For Dates we are using [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) library,
   install it only if the component needs to use it, or if you need it in general

5. For Icons we are using [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/), you can use your preferred icon library

6. These are the basics, any extra packages will be mentioned for the component itself
